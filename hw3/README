Compile/run: Compile using "make MetroSim", run executable with
"./MetroSim stationsFile passFile [commands]"

Program Purpose: This homework assignment handles a running train
to accomodate passengers arriving/departing a metro. Learn how to
design and modularize code and work with documented libraries.

Acknowledgements: 

Files: 
main.cpp: STUDENT TO-DO: Main file should be short and handle 
simple driver functions such as reading in files. 

MetroSim.cpp: STUDENT TO-DO: Implementation of MetroSim class.
Main functionality of running the Metro Simulation, should be
able to move trains and deal with passengers going on/off the 
train. 

MetroSim.h: STUDENT TO-DO: Interface of MetroSim class.

Station.cpp: Implementation of Station class. Allows for various
functions related to accessing the information of the Station
class and modifying passengers. 

Station.h: Interface of Station class.

stations.txt: an example file containing a list of stations.

test_commands.txt: sample list of commands that you could give to
the simulator

Data Structures:

Testing: Here describe the following: process of testing 
(unit tests), mention of bugs you encountered while testing,
mention of testing on inputs of different sizes and edge
cases, good description of base cases you considered while
testing. Demonstrate a methodical approach to testing. This 
section of your REAMDE should be very thorough for homework
assignments. 

Note: This homework comes partially implemented, but student must
also create the driver and add class functionality.
